Title: Ordered Containers with Integer Keys
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Stéphane Laurent
Maintainer: Stéphane Laurent <laurent_step@outlook.fr>
Description: Provides a key-value store data structure. The keys are
    integers and the values can be any R object. This is like a list but
    indexed by a set of integers, not necessarily contiguous and possibly
    negative. The implementation uses a 'R6' class. These containers are 
    not faster than lists but their usage can be more convenient for 
    certain situations.
